# Lagrange Polynomial demo using p5.js
Written with the help of [p5.js](https://p5js.org). Demonstrates how [Lagrange polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial)s work. Required for [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) to recover the secret. Code is modular so will work in other projects. 

**Demo is [here](https://c3ypt1c.github.io/LagrangePolynomialP5/).**

## How to use:
- Click to place a point (up to 10).
- Click and drag on ball to move it.
