`Edge Server` is an old computer and `TP_Link` is a wireless router.

I set up my router to act like a wireless switch. It will funnel the traffic from each respected SSID to their correct network and disallow cross talking. I used two separate cables to split the normal and untrusted traffic. Admittedly, I couldn't figure out how to set up VLANs so this was the way that I decided to do it.

- Server network can access any other network.
- Normal network can only access the WAN and Untrusted network.
- Untrusted devices have no access to any network including the internet.

### Server network
The server network consists of bridged virtual machines and physical devices. It's protected so that only devices inside the network can connect to it. It has full reign over the network.

### Normal network
This network is the default network that my devices would connect to. This means devices that need access to the internet, and my family's wireless devices.

### Untrusted network
The untrusted network has devices that I would consider evil. They don't have any access to the internet and all of their activities can be accessed from the outside from the other networks. I primarily use this network to run my camera system. I cannot risk the cameras sending any data to the internet because of privacy.
