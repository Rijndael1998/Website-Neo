Mirror's Edge, released in 2008, is a truly unique video game that still stands the test of time. Its distinctive lighting and simple mechanics turn it into a stunning experience even today.

Mirror's Edge has a special place in my heart. I fell in love with this game instantly when I discovered it around age 13. I had a pretty bad laptop back then (think AMD APU R8 graphics), but it still ran fine, and I enjoyed the game even on very modest hardware. The game also connected with me on a deeper level. Around the same time, I remember other movement-oriented games—mainly the early Assassin's Creed titles and, specifically, I Am Alive. These games inspired me to try parkour, through which I met many of my friends at the time.

What I remember most about this game is its one-of-a-kind visual style, which drew me back years later to write this article. Since playing it as a young teenager, I've picked up various skills—some in graphic design, some in 3D modeling and rendering. I decided to replay the game after feeling disappointed by its successor and to find inspiration.

The first thing that inspired me is the start screen depicting the City of Glass, which you can see reflected in my final render. It's so serene and simple, yet it also has impossibly stylized lighting, and replicating it in Blender was very, very challenging.

    cap

After toying around with files I got from a user on Reddit, the first thing I tried was to slap an HDRI onto the scene and call it a day. This gave me subpar results. The composited mist was ruining the scene. The reflections didn't take the mist into account at all, so it had to be removed.

    cap

My second attempt also felt subpar. The water and sky were blue, which gave me realistic results; however, this isn't present in the game's menu. If I were trying to recreate a level from Mirror's Edge, I would have been very happy, since the levels often feature a vibrant, singular primary color. But here, that simply wouldn't do.

What followed were several sleepless hours trying to figure out how the scene could be made in the first place. This led to a long period of learning and getting a grasp on color correction.

    src={image.blender_world}
    alt="My world shader."
    cap
/>

I modified the World texture to achieve the pale white skies depicted in the menu. I also wanted to preserve the sun's shape, so I isolated it from the rest of the image and then reconstructed it with the nodes above.

<LazyLocalImage
    aspectRatio={1}

    alt="Raw render."
    cap
/>

<LazyLocalImage
    aspectRatio={1}
    src={image.blender_final}
    alt="Processed render."
    cap
/>

These changes, combined with the compositor, create an image in the style of the Mirror's Edge menu, and I'm very happy with the result. I even made a short animation in the style of the main menu itself.
