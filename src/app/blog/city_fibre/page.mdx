# Get OpenWRT to work on Octaplus networks

[CityFibre](https://cityfibre.com/) provides fast, fiberoptic internet to the UK. [Octaplus](https://octaplus.co.uk/) is one of the providers for CityFibre but they didn't make it straight forward for me to set up my own "router". The only thing that they told me to do was "tag the vlan with `911`, username is `firstName_lastName` and password is `london`". At the time, I was very much new to OpenWRT, and I didn't understand anything (I still don't) about how the system worked. I couldn't get it to work during the support call.



### Caveat
However, setting up all of these things still didn't make it work. That's when I remember talking to support during some other time about the security of their system. The support person was very eager to point out that regardless of the authentication/tagging being used, the security is based on mac address. The only issue with this is that you can go war driving for the "octaplus_broadband" SSID, find the mac address. To make it fully work, I simply spoofed my previous device's mac address...
