# Marta Fundraiser's

Taking care of three small children is no easy task. Being a single mother adds to the challenge, and facing the battle with cancer can feel overwhelming. Our friend Marta embodied remarkable strength, resilience, and determination during such a difficult time. She was fighting breast cancer, an illness that affects 1 in 8 women, while also raising her three children on her own.
