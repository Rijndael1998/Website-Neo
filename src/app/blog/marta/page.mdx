# Marta's Fundraiser

<Gallery />

Taking care of three small children is no easy task. Being a single mother adds to the challenge, and facing cancer can feel overwhelming. Our friend Marta embodied remarkable strength, resilience, and determination during such a difficult time. She was fighting breast cancer, an illness that affects one in eight women, while also raising her three children on her own.

By December 2022, Marta was struggling with only the bare essentials to get by. She had minimal furniture: an old table, a set of drawers, a small sofa, and a few chairs. One of the issues she faced was finding an efficient way to dry clothes; she relied on a simple clothes dryer and, because of the poor weather, drying often took more than 24 hours. Additionally, she didn't have adequate storage for clothes and was finding it difficult to study online for her university course.

My mom, Matylda, and I wanted to assist her in a meaningful way. Although we had helped her with smaller tasks in the past, this time the need was greater than what we could manage on our own. My mom, who owns a small business, saw an opportunity to raise funds by selling handmade candles through her [shop](https://matilda-gifts.shop/). However, finding a suitable place to sell the candles was a challenge.

We turned to a close family friend, a priest in Bolton who oversees a Polish Catholic mission, and he graciously allowed us to sell the candles at the churches where he celebrates Mass.

Nearly all of the candles were sold, and we raised a total of £471. In addition, my employer, [IPF](/portfolio/ipf), generously contributed £250. With the combined funds, we were able to purchase new furniture, a clothes dryer, and a new laptop for Marta to use in her studies, as well as Christmas gifts for her children.
