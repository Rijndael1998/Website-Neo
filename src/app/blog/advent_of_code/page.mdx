# Completing Advent of Code 2024!
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is a yearly event including programming puzzles. The format usually includes a large text based input and a single text based output. I have never full completed an Advent of Code event and got all of the solutions. I will do it for the first time here!

The first puzzle drops on the 1st of December 2024. Stay tuned until then. ðŸ˜‰
