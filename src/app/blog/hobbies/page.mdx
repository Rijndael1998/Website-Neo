# Hobbies

## Music
On occasion, I like to do stuff to do with music. I can play the piano. I can play: 
 - [For river (Johnny's Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiW6akLxrCM)
 - [Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItpJJmZtXL0)
 - [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZW57CMgpo)
 - Others, but probably not as well.

The list isn't extensive but I just can't remember what I can play right now.

I have also tried my hand at remixing music, here I am remixing Crab Rave as a ring tone: <audio controls src="/music/crab_rave.mp3" />

It might sound a little weird because it was specifically designed as a looping ring tone for my phone.
When I listen to it on my computer using my headphones, it sounds very empty on the lower frequencies
but on the phone, it's a lot better, as the phone has less of an ability to produce lower frequency 
sounds. It arguably sounds "correct" on a phone.

## AI
I tried my hand at AI generation using Open AI's DALLÂ·E. It's how I made the image to go with this portfolio page. 
I think the way in which the content is rather interesting. It involves a lot of trial and error, and it's not as straight forward as some people imagine,
but it's a lot easier than learning to paint or getting someone else to paint your mind.

### Prompting
I started off by doing some basic prompting: 

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={469 / 928}
    images={[]}
/>

As you can see, prompting is a gradual process. It really helps if you understand what the model might be 
misinterpreting or misunderstanding

### Refining
After prompting, you can pick an image you like and check out its variations, like you can do here:

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={574 / 1281}
    images={[]}
/>

import mod_final from "./images/mod_final.png";

If you're not exactly happy with the image that you have, you can always inpaint the parts that you want to change, then run the image with a prompt. This is what I got when I made this last image:
<LazyLocalImage alt="Inpainting" src={mod_final} />

### Finished product

import crab_rave from "./opengraph-image.png";

And here's the finished result. Unfortunately, image generation AI still doesn't know how to count. Crabs typically have 10 legs, but the AI generated a crab with 6... That's 4 too fewer. However, the crab in the image reminds me of a poison headcrab from Half Life, so maybe that's the cause?????? Regardless, I liked the picture enough to put it here.
