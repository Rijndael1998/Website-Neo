# Hobbies

## Music
<div>
Occasionally, I make music and play piano. Pieces I can play include: 
 - [For river (Johnny's Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiW6akLxrCM)
 - [Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItpJJmZtXL0)
 - [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZW57CMgpo)
 - Others, but probably not as well.
</div>

This list isn't exhaustive — I'm just blanking on the rest right now.

Occasionally, I make music and play piano. Pieces I can play include: <audio controls src="/music/crab_rave.mp3" />

It might sound a little odd because it was designed to loop as a phone ringtone. On headphones it can feel light in the low frequencies, but on a phone — which has limited ability to reproduce low end — it sounds more balanced. You could argue it sounds "correct" on a phone.

## AI
I tried AI image generation with OpenAI's DALL·E; it's how I made the image for this portfolio page. I find the process interesting. It involves a lot of trial and error and isn't as straightforward as some people imagine, but it's still easier than learning to paint or hiring someone to paint what's in your head.

### Prompting
I started off with some basic prompting:

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={469 / 928}
    images={images.allIs}
/>

As you can see, prompting is a gradual process. It really helps if you understand what the model might be misinterpreting.

### Refining
After prompting, you can pick an image you like and explore its variations, like you can do here:

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={574 / 1281}
    images={[{src: images.mod_1}, {src: images.mod_2}]}
/>

If you're not satisfied with an image, you can inpaint the parts you want to change and then run it with a prompt. Here's what I got for the final pass:
<LazyLocalImage alt="Inpainting" src={images.mod_final} />

### Finished product

And here's the finished result. Unfortunately, image-generation AI still doesn't always count reliably. Crabs typically have 10 limbs, but the AI generated a crab with 6 — four too few. The crab in the image reminds me of a poison headcrab from Half-Life, so maybe that's why it looks the way it does. Regardless, I liked the picture enough to put it here.

<LazyLocalImage alt="Final Picture" src={images.crab_rave} />
