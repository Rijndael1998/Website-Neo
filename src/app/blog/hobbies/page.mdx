# Hobbies

## Music

On occasion, I like to do stuff to do with music. I can play the piano. I can play: 
 - [For river (Johnny's Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiW6akLxrCM)
 - [Shelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItpJJmZtXL0)
 - [After Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeZW57CMgpo)

The list isn't extensive but I just can't remember what I can play right now.

I have also tried my hand at remixing music, here I am remixing Crab Rave as a ring tone:

<audio controls src="/fun/hobbies/music/crab_rave.mp3" />

It might sound a little weird because it was specifically designed as a looping ring tone for my phone. When I listen to it on my computer using my headphones, it sounds very empty on the lower frequencies but on the phone, it's a lot better, as the phone has less of an ability to produce lower frequency  sounds. It arguably sounds "correct" on a phone.

## AI

I tried my hand at AI generation using Open AI's DALLÂ·E. It's how I made the image to go with this portfolio page. I think the way in which the content is rather interesting. It involves a lot of trial and error, and it's not as straight forward as some people imagine, but it's a lot easier than learning to paint or getting someone else to paint your mind.

### Prompting

I started off by doing some basic prompting: 

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={469 / 928}
    images={
        [
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/1.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/2.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/3.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/4.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/5.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/6.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/7.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/8.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/9.png"},
            {src: "/fun/hobbies/ai/10.png"},
        ]
    }
/>

As you can see, prompting is a gradual process. It really helps if you understand what the model might be misinterpreting or misunderstanding.

### Refining

<ImageGallery
    aspectRatio={574 / 1281}
    images={
        ["/fun/hobbies/ai/mod1.png", "/fun/hobbies/ai/mod2.png"].map((item) => {
            return { src: item }
        })
    }
/>

After prompting, you can pick an image you like and check out its variations, like you can do here:

<LazyImage alt="Inpainting" aspectRatio={574 / 1281} src="/fun/hobbies/ai/modfinal.png" />

If you're not exactly happy with the image that you have, you can always inpaint the parts that you want to change, then run the image with a prompt. This is what I got when I made this last image:

### Finished product

<LazyImage alt="Final Picture" aspectRatio={1} src="/fun/crab_rave.png" />

And here's the finished result. Unfortunately, image generation AI still doesn't know how to count. Crabs typically have 10 legs, but the AI generated a crab with 6... That's 4 too fewer. However, the crab in the image reminds me of a poison headcrab from Half Life, so maybe that's the cause?????? Regardless, I liked the picture enough to put it here.
