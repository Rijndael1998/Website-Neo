## My contributions to research
I run it through a virtual machine on my server. I have delegated around 50% of my compute power when the virtual machine is running. That's 8 out of 16 threads from my Ryzen 7 1800x CPU. I used to also fold using my graphics cards, however, there's no real support for them in my server software.

<FoldingCount /> I have been donating resources for a long time, since the start of the Covid pandemic, to help in developing medicine. I used to have a different username and a much less powerful computer so I decided to start fresh around the time I first published this website. It felt like a nice change. My current account is [`rijn.dev`](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/name/rijn.dev).
