## Secret sharing
Lagrange polynomials are an important tool in algebra and number theory, commonly used in interpolation. Named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, this approach provides a means of constructing a polynomial that passes through a specified set of points. The uniqueness of this polynomial is guaranteed as long as it is of degree less than or equal to one less than the number of points.

Now, moving to secret sharing, it is a method used in information security to split a secret, like a password, into multiple parts. These parts (or 'shares') are distributed among a group of participants. To reconstruct the original secret, a certain number of shares ('threshold') are required. If you don't have enough shares, you can't get the secret.

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a popular secret sharing scheme which was introduced by Adi Shamir, who is also a co-inventor of the RSA algorithm. Shamir's scheme is said to be (t, n) threshold scheme because it distributes the secret into 'n' shares in such a way that 't' of them are needed to reconstruct the original secret.

This secret sharing scheme uses the concept of polynomial interpolation, specifically Lagrange polynomial to reconstruct the original secret.

<div>
Here is how it works:
 1. Initially, A secret 's' is chosen. This is the secret you want to share.
 2. A polynomial of degree 't-1' is generated randomly, with the condition that the constant term is 's'.
 3. 'n' different points from this polynomial are evaluated and these are the 'n' shares.
 4. To recover 's', the Lagrange interpolation formula is applied to 't' distinct points.
</div>

The security of Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme stems from the properties of polynomials. It ensures that even if an attacker has 't-1' shares, they still can't figure out the secret - they would need at least 't' shares. It's also important to note that any 't' shares will work, not just a specific set.

These polynomials, and therefore Shamir's Secret Sharing, can be used in a [password manager](/portfolio/passwordManager) to distribute the master key safely among a group of select individuals. The master key could be divided into parts and given to different individuals. When needed, the key can be reconstructed by gathering a certain threshold of these parts. This ensures the security of the password manager as the master key is not stored in one place, therefore significantly decreasing the chance of the key getting exposed to potential threats.
