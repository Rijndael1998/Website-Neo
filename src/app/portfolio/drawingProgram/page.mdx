# Drawing Program

<GalleryImage src={imageBaseURL + "Hue.png"} aspectRatio={382 / 439} alt="" />

This is one of my third year university projects. The program can let you draw anything that you might like. You can download a demo [here](/fun/ase/Advanced%20Software%20Engineering.exe). Simply run the executable. It should run under Wine, but I experienced problems with the file locator. The source available repository is [here](https://github.com/Rijndael1998/Advanced-Software-Engineering-Drawing-Project).

## Custom language
It is a simple drawing program that uses a programming language designed for this project. I was instructed to create a program to meet a specific set of [guidelines](/fun/ase/L6ASE2020assignmentSpec.pdf). I achieved 100% of the available marks in this project, meeting all of the criteria necessary.

Some of the requirements were:
 - Drawing of basic shapes and lines, like circles and squares.
 - The ability to store and retrieve variables.
 - Flow control, more specifically, <code>if</code> statements.
 - Methods and functions. Specifically functions with or without parameters (recursions was not required).
 - Loading and unloading programs.
 - Error detection.

## Gallery
<ImageGallery images={gallery} />

## Documentation
It was required that the software engineering project is fully documented. Every class has documentation regarding its use and place in the program. The documentation was generated using [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen). You can read the documentation [here](/fun/ase/Advanced%20Software%20Engineering/Docs/html/index.html).

## Videos
I go over these and my code in two videos. 
I don't recommend watching them because they are really long and might 
be really boring. It was requirement for the project. They're here:

## Example with code
<ImageGallery images={example} />

### Code: 
```
var x = 0
var y = 0
var offset = 128

while x < offset 
  y = 0
  while y < offset 
    move x, y
    pen x, y, x + y
    dot
    y = y + 1
  end
  y = 0
  while y < offset 
    move x + offset, y
    pen y + x, y, x
    dot
    y = y + 1
  end
  x = x + 1
end

x = 0
while x < offset 
  y = 0
  while y < offset 
    move x, y + offset, 
    pen y + x, offset - y, offset - x
    dot
    y = y + 1
  end
  y = 0
  while y < offset 
    move x + offset, y + offset
    pen x + y, offset - x, offset - y
    dot
    y = y + 1
  end
  x = x + 1
end
```
