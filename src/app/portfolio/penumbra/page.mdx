# Penumbra

<LazyLocalImage src={image} />

It was my first every game jam that I took a part of.

I worked with 5 others on the creation of this game.

We had some loosely defined roles in the game and links to their itch.io pages:
    - [Jman](https://jman9092.itch.io/): Project management & Music
    - [Freya](https://nanofreya.itch.io/): Sprites & UI
    - [Astra Anima](https://astraanima.itch.io/): Sprites, UI & SFX
    - [Flxli](https://flxli227.itch.io/): Code & UI
    - [Alifeee](https://alifeee.itch.io/): Code
    - [Me](https://rijndael1998.itch.io/): Code


My primary contribution was the code for the game. I worked mainly on the enemies and the drops, but I touched all the bits of code in the game.


Here's the entire [`gource`](https://gource.io/) video of the entire development history:

Notice how much of the code development work was done by [Alifeee](https://alifeee.co.uk/). Their contributions were priceless to the creation of the game and it wouldn't be in the place it is now without their help.
