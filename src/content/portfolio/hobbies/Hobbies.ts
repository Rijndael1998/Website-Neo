The list isn't extensive but I just can't remember what I can play right now.

I have also tried my hand at remixing music, here I am remixing Crab Rave as a ring tone:

It might sound a little weird because it was specifically designed as a looping ring tone for my phone.
When I listen to it on my computer using my headphones, it sounds very empty on the lower frequencies
but on the phone, it's a lot better, as the phone has less of an ability to produce lower frequancy 
sounds. It arguably sounds "correct" on a phone.

export const AIContent1 = `I tried my hand at AI generation using Open AI's DALLÂ·E. It's how I made the image to go with this portfolio page. 
I think the way in which the content is rather interesting. It involves a lot of trial and error, and it's not as straight forward as some people imagine,
but it's a lot easier than learning to paint or getting someone else to paint your mind.`

inpaint the parts that you want to change, then run the image with a prompt. This is what I got when I made this last image:`

export const AISub3 = `Finished product`

export const AIContent6 = `And here's the finished result. Unfortunately, image generation AI still doesn't know how to count. 
Crabs typically have 10 legs, but the AI generated a crab with 6... That's 4 too fewer. However, the crab in the image reminds me of a poison headcrab from Half Life,
 so maybe that's the cause?????? Regardless, I liked the picture enough to put it here.`
